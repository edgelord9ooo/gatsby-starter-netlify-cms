## Today
<hr/>
The snow fell hard, in large white clumps that turned the city and its sidewalks into a white sheet. Yet it was warm; today was a bright and very warm day,especially after the frozen winter hell of the past month that saw temperatures of below -20 degrees celsius and an extreme weather warning that accompanied most of January and February.
